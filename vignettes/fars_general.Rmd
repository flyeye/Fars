## Fars data and routings 

This package contains routings designed for processing and visualizing of the data files provided by [US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's](https://www.nhtsa.gov/) Fatality Analysis Reporting System, which is a US nationwide census providing the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes. The raw data files for years 2013, 2014 and 2015 are included in the package and can be accessed by the following code:

```{r}
 year <- as.integer(2014)
 system.file("extdata", sprintf("accident_%d.csv.bz2", year), package = "Fars")

```

Fars package consist of a few function, providing access to this data, some simple processing and visualising. This functions are descibed below.
